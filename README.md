# Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard is a weather app that allows users to get the weather forecast for the city that is searched with, along with other useful information such as weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The date and time for the searched city will show up above the temperature, and the time will be updated per minute. The weather icon for the city will change based on the weather for that day.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and javascript were used to build the webpage. Bootstrap, fontawesome, and google fonts were used for layout and design. One Call API and Geocoding API from openweathermap were used to pull data for the weather forecasts.

## Future Implementations
An hourly option will be added to allow for more in depth details regarding the weather for the entire day. Air pollution rating will also be provided to the users to inform about air quality.
